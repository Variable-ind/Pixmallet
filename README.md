# Pixmallet

A Pixel Art tool made by godot 4.x. inspired by pixelorama.

I want make a roguelike game with pixel art.

When I find pixelorama, I few it is quite fit my needs,
but when I am try to make some tiny teeny modify from pixelorama,
after speand few days deal with the source code, I gave up. 

I don't understand the purpose of the way who design the software.
So many refrence from global object, almost every where.
That's make modification so diffcalue. 
Actually, it's impassable to change some features.

So I start a new project to re-build another one.
That's Pixmallet has been borned. 
also for get deep knowlage with Godot 4.x by the way.

It's not finish yet, almost done. almost....
